Description:
    Creates the files necessary to link the Svelte frontend with the Rails backend so that the frontend
    can receive all fields defined in the backend.

Example:
    bin/rails generate svelte_model Book

    This will create:
        /app
            /frontend
                /modules
                    /Book
                        Book.ts <- class into which to put any specific Svelte-side methods to fornmat, validate
                                   or otherwise manipulate the class.  Rerunning the generator will not touch this
                                   file.
                        BookData.ts <- class containing definition of all the data fields in the Rails backend database.
                                   This file is regenerated each time, so that any changes to the database/model
                                   structure in Rails will be reflected in the files.
                    FetchData.ts <- contains the code that does the heavy lifting of fetching the data from the backend.
                                   Only created if the file does not exist.

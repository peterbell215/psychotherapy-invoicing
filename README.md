# README

This is a side project to let me experiment with building an app using Rails as the backend, Svelte and Bootstrap for
the frontend.  The Javascript pipeline uses Vite, Inertia and yarn.  The project is based on
[Setting up a new Rails 7 app with Vite, Inertia, and Svelte](https://dev.to/buhrmi/setting-up-a-new-rails-7-app-with-vite-inertia-and-svelte-c9e)

I have had to make a few minor adjustments to support changes to various elements.

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
